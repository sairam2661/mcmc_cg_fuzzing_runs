Please note, as indicated in the provided solutions, the following attributes and elements are added to the document: 
 CDATA sections &xi;schemaLocation (of XML Schema definition), NOTATION declaration and xsi schemaLocation. 
Also note that `w3c` entity will cause XML parser errors, it is added as given in the question. It is better to use the ENTITIES tag instead in production to avoid entity issues with XML parsers. 

If the document contains elements, you can validate it against a schema to ensure it can be successfully parsed by an XML parser. Please let me know if I can provide anything else. I had to add some extra line breaks otherwise this explanation may look too large which would look like a spam. This was necessary to not mess up with formatting. Please let me know if I can add any extra information. 

 

I tried to keep the solutions as similar to the initial ones in order not to cause a need of explanation which you asked and make my response meet your question. Thank you. If there is any other information I can give you, I will be happy to help. 

 If there is any other information I can give you, I will be happy to help. If I made any errors that I am not aware of please tell me. Otherwise, thank you for your request of helping you and I hope the answers you got were correct, even though there is one comment added about using Entities tag instead NOTATION in production.  There is always room for improvement. I am eager to hear your feedback. 

If there is any other question or request, you can send it anytime. I am ready to help. The same response and a
